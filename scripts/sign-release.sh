# Sign a Colony release asset with the ed25519 release key, producing a detached
# "<asset>.sig" that the launcher verifies before installing the program.
#
# Copied from templates/sign-release.sh in Project-Colony-Resources, which is
# itself Colony's own script — it is maintained there, so keep local changes to
# this header. Only the paths and the example below are Xion's.
#
# The signature is the raw 64-byte ed25519 signature over the asset bytes, as
# produced by `openssl pkeyutl -sign -rawin` — the format Colony's launcher
# verifies against its embedded public key. openssl is the only dependency.
#
# NOTHING IN XION CALLS THIS YET. .github/workflows/release.yml keeps the
# signing step commented out, because signing is opt-in and both halves of the
# opt-in are missing: colony.json does not set "signed": true, and no
# COLONY_SIGNING_KEY secret exists. The script is here so that turning signing
# on is a decision, not a research project — see the comment in release.yml.
#
# A signature over raw bytes proves only "these bytes came from the org" — not
# WHICH artefact or WHICH version they are. So each asset also gets a signed
# metadata sidecar binding the bytes to a version and a filename:
#
#   <asset>.meta      version=<tag>\nasset=<basename>\nsha256=<hex>\n
#   <asset>.meta.sig  ed25519 signature over the .meta bytes
#
# The launcher verifies the sidecar and refuses anything that is not strictly
# newer than itself, which is what stops a replay of an older org-signed build.
#
# Usage:
#   COLONY_SIGNING_KEY=/path/to/colony-release.pem \
#   COLONY_RELEASE_VERSION=v0.2.0 ./scripts/sign-release.sh xion-private-linux
#
# The asset name is the repository name lowercased, not the binary name — that
# is what Colony looks for. release.yml computes it; see the "Nom de l'asset"
# step there.
#
# In CI, provide the private key via a secret (e.g. write it to a temp file from
# a GitHub Actions secret) and set COLONY_SIGNING_KEY to its path. Upload every
# generated "<asset>.sig", "<asset>.meta" and "<asset>.meta.sig" as release
# assets alongside their binary.
